		    	Under the Act, any child who is resident within Kenya is eligible for adoption, whether or not the child is a Kenyan citizen, and whether it was born in Kenya or not. The child has to be at least six weeks old and has to be declared free for adoption by a registered adoption society. 
			Before making an application for an adoption order, the child to be adopted must have been in the continuous care and control of the applicant in Kenya for a period of three consecutive months preceding the filing of the application. Both the child and applicant(s) must also be evaluated and assessed by a registered adoption society in Kenya.

		    	Adoption is the legal process by which a person obtains parental rights over a child. The Children Act No. 8 of 2001 (the Act) and the Hague Adoption Convention, which Kenya is a signatory to, govern adoptions in Kenya. Adoption can be classified into three categories.
